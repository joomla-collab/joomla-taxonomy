# Joomla! Content Taxonomy System

Joomla is in sore need of a true taxonomic content system. The need of a third-party extension to accomplish that goal is not acceptable, if Joomla is to reach the next level, be enterprise-ready, and suitable for large-scale projects.

Converting Joomla to a true taxonomic system seems to be an unsourmontable task, but with careful planning and clever project design, I believe it can be achieved with non-major interventions to the core code.

With the advent of custom fields, and the ability to "plug" them to com_content, Joomla has reached a point where a taxonomic system is right around the corner. By refactoring com_content to use com_fields as its foundation for *all fields*, and creating a few backward compatibility workarounds, Joomla can accomplish the implementation of a taxonomic system for J4.0 *at launch*.

This project was initially concocted in Adobe XD, with both the source file and published prototype provided below. If you miss some interactions, just consider that the prototype is under active development/creation, and use the screen navigator to go through screens. Comments are welcome, and should be opened as issues under this repository.

The next phase will be to convert this into an HTML5 prototype, where contributors can add their ideas or fork into a similar proposal.

Adobe XD prototype for review: https://xd.adobe.com/view/ff251668-87f6-4b78-59c4-745d27c1dfe9-8914/ 

If you would like to have access to the original XD file, please send me a personal message on GitHub, and I will provide a copy. If you want to collaborate, and edit the same cloud file, please PM me with your adobe ID email, and I will share it with you with editing permissions.

**Important note:** this work is being created with the intention of inclusion into core Joomla. No permission is granted to turn it, either as a whole or just parts of it, into a free or commercially developed extension, module, plugin or something else, not for Joomla or any other CMS. After the work is completed, license might be granted on a case by case basis, after careful analysis.
